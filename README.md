# SingingChristmasTree

The following project combines pi 3B+ and arduino uno to create a functioning robotic mouth that syncs up to a mp3.
Pi and Arduino are linked via serial utilizing the USB connection. ***Note serial path may differ from /dev/ttyAM0***
CSV files are created with millisecond time values and coresponding positional values are assigned. 
Current build will include a video file projecting mapped eyes to provide additional movement.
