# SingingChristmasTree

The following project combines pi 3B+ and arduino uno to create a functioning robotic mouth that syncs up to a mp3.
CSV files are created with millisecond time values and coresponding positional values are assigned. 
Current build will include a video file projecting mapped eyes to provide additional movement.
All associated files are intelectual property of Joshua Thorell and as such need to be properly cited if used. 
All media is licensed for private use and as such will need to be aquired by the individual user.
